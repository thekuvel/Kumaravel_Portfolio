Luc retired.

## Luc

My favourite colleague retired on **30-Jan-2026**. He made a huge impact on my professional life—on how I see colleagues, how I approach problems, and how I show up at work every day.

Luc had a rare gift: he could make even the most stressful situations feel lighter. He kept the environment fun, human, and positive, no matter what we were dealing with. I will miss him more than anyone, without a doubt.

## Things He Often Said

Luc had a way with words—simple lines that stayed with you.

- **During major incidents:** *“Only opportunities.”*  
- **During KT sessions:** *“Only stupid answers, no stupid questions.”*  
- **During scrum:** Often roasting himself before anyone else could 😄

Each line carried his mindset: optimistic, inclusive, and refreshingly honest.

## What I Will Miss

- Long calls that never felt long  
- His humor, especially when it was most needed  
- His guidance, subtle but powerful

## The Last Call

We officially had our last call before he logged out for good. It was hard to accept—but also comforting to realize that he’s stepping into a new chapter of life.

No more workloads.  
No more deadlines.  
Just living life to the fullest, exactly the way he likes it.

Only opportunities.
