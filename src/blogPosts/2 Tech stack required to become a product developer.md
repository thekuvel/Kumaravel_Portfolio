# Code first, clean later.

Recently, I embarked on learning the SCRUM framework through a course on Udemy. This decision stemmed from my need to rapidly develop and release my personal project, Quwad. Unfortunately, the project has already been delayed, and I've found myself struggling to make significant progress at the pace I had hoped for.

In the past, I believed that methodologies like SCRUM and Agile were more suited for large teams or enterprise-level projects, and I thought I could skip them for personal projects. Well, I was wrong.

After spending some time exploring SCRUM and Agile principles, I realized how incredibly beneficial these frameworks are, even for solo developers. SCRUM, a widely used Agile framework, is designed to deliver results in a structured, iterative way, allowing you to adapt quickly and improve continuously.

By applying SCRUM, I can break down the development of Quwad into smaller, manageable iterations. This approach will not only help me stay focused but also enable me to release incremental updates much more quickly. Instead of trying to perfect the project all at once, I can deliver functional portions of it regularly, which will keep momentum going and allow me to gather valuable feedback along the way.

A key mindset shift I've adopted is the "Code first, clean later" approach. The idea is to prioritize building and delivering working features first, without worrying too much about perfection. Once the core functionality is in place, I can refine and optimize the code in later iterations.

Moving forward, I plan to develop Quwad in cycles, focusing on one feature at a time, and delivering it as soon as it's ready. This iterative approach will help me meet deadlines, stay organized, and—most importantly—keep my project moving forward.

Learning SCRUM has already started to transform how I approach software development, and I'm excited to see how it accelerates the completion of Quwad and future projects.

Code First, Clean Later.
