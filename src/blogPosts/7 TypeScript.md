TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript.

## What is TypeScript?

At first glance, TypeScript (TS) may feel like extra boilerplate code, but it's actually a powerful extension of JavaScript. If you already know JavaScript, learning TypeScript is straightforward, you’re essentially adding **types** to your existing code.

TypeScript helps you catch errors **before** your code runs, makes your code more maintainable, and improves collaboration in larger projects. It has become a must-have skill for JavaScript developers. In fact, almost all modern SaaS products and tech companies that rely on JavaScript use TypeScript by default.

### Why Learn TypeScript?

- **Error Prevention:** Catch type-related bugs during development rather than at runtime.
- **Better Tooling:** Enjoy enhanced autocomplete, code navigation, and refactoring support.
- **Scalability:** Makes large codebases easier to manage and maintain.
- **Industry Standard:** Widely adopted in the tech industry, improving your job marketability.
